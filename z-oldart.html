      <h2 class="arth2">Sketches and old work</h2>

      <div class="artcontainer">
          <p>The sketches you'll see here were made fairly recently and mostly just for fun. The more finished works here are some older ones I still wanted to show. 
              The project on the left here was a project I made for a school assignment. It was a fairly open exercise. I took great inspiration from an impressionist artist I love, Claude Monet. 
              He had a garden he made himself that functioned as a small ecosystem. From this I thought of a space traveller called M0n3t who had a garden consisting of plants from various different planets. 
              All the plants had some connection to each other. One making a resource the other used, for instance. This also made a small ecosystem, just like the real garden. 
              <br><br>
              There was also a journal I made that had all the plants listed inside, almost like a botanical, that also detailed what he found travelling. I also put in a work that was part of a practical exam. 
              For this work I decided to work with multiple styles to tell different stories, centered around a window salesman. Windows into different lives.
