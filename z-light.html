              This project was about my artistic journey to make a gen-art processing sketch relating to music. The premise sounds very vague, but I'm happy with how I made it my own. 
              I started experimenting with how light shone through objects and got my inspiration from there. Light is and has always been very relevant for me. As someone with a great passion for art, light is what allows us to see. 
              It also has a great influence on how we see color in day to day life. That is what I wanted to "shed some light on" (pun very much intended). 
              <br><br>
              I started by filming myself while experimenting with the flash on my phone and some see through objects. 
              I had some fake gems that made cool shapes appear, some see through paper and plastics and every slightly clear, colored object I could find. Then I took those shapes and started making them in processing. 
              Then I animated them to the beats of various types of music and added some random elements to make it a form of interesting gen art, while keeping some level of control over how the outcome would look. 
              <br><br>
              I made three scenes. One based on how prisms split light, one based on the shapes of the gems I shone light through in my tests and one based on stars and light in space. 
              It was a project I had great fun with, am still very proud of and even presented in an exposition with other people from my study. 
              This project really showed me how much fun it can be to go through a phase of artistic research and make that into a full fledged, personal project.

              <!-- The project originally worked with an Arduino (a small mini computer) to control everything in the processing sketch, but I reworked the website to work with keyboard instead. 
              If some things don't work optimally, that is because there was originally different types of buttons for that. All the music used is also themed after light.             
              <a href="" class="textlink" target="_blank">Try it out here!</a> (I've added the version without music here, but originally there was a version where the bpm was decided by music)
