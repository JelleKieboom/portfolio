          <p>This is the one group project I've included here. I was responsible for coding the final website and most of the teaching we had to do for this project. 
          We were asked to make a coding workshop for kids of primary schools around the region. We had to teach kids the basics of using P5JS. 
          <br><br>
          We decided to make a fake company called Skillit. 
          This company would make various types of workshops you'd be able to find on the website. On the website, you can see the page for the workshop we made, though there aren't pages for the other fictional workshops. 
          I found the teaching aspect of this project particularily fun. Taking the lead in front of the classroom and really seeing how kids enjoy and learn from the workshop was a great experience. 
          And the workshop turned out to be a huge succes, some kids even went on to continue coding at home in the environment we had set up for them. 
          <br><br>
          We went with a cops and robbers theme to give the entire workshop a story and keep it engaging. 
          I really learned how rewarding teamwork can be from this project, as it was one of the first times I had worked as well in a team as I did during this project.  <br><br>
