            <p class="altprojectsp">This was my first project at my study and I look back at the website in two ways. At first with fond memories of what I learned, but also with a big desire to change everything. 
                The project served as an introductory course to what we would learn at our study. We had to do research, write texts, do the photography, do interviews and design and code the website ourselves. 
                <br><br>
                It was a lot of fun and I learned a ton by working on this project. Because it was my first go at designing a website and at coding, a lot of things aren't nearly as optimal as they could be. 
                One very obvious change I would make nowadays is working moreso with much more responsive variables like viewwidth, instead of just pixel amounts. 
                Or something like I did on this page, where the box surrounding this text rescales with the inner content on it's own. That's not something I knew how to do back then.
