<p id="aboutp">Hello, my name is Jelle Kieboom. I'm a Dutch student at the Communication and Multimedia Design study in Maastricht and I have a passion for design centered around humans.
My dream is to create a whole bunch of things that can improve the lives of people. For this I love designing all sorts of things from the perspective of the user. 
This includes websites, apps and more, but my main passion is making games that teach the user something. This lesson can be an unforgettable experience, a memorable story, or useful real world knowledge. 
<br><br>
I've also been making art since I was very young, always finding it relaxing and fun. Art is another method of communication I think is very important, as you can tell people things that mere words can't express. 
Digital art and physical art are equally interesting to me, though they both offer distinct benefits. I also love sitting behind my computer and programming. It's always a fun challenge to overcome challenges set by myself or others. 
The end result is always something to look forward to, wether it be a game or website, so of course I jumped at the chance to make this portfolio myself! 
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, feel free to contact me if you want to work together, or just want to chat!
